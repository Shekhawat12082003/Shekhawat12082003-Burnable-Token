# Burnable Token  

## 📌 Project Title  
**Burnable Token**  

## 📖 Project Description  
Burnable Token is a fungible token built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.  
It introduces a mechanism where token holders can **permanently destroy (burn) their tokens**, reducing the total supply.  
The contract ensures secure initialization of the token supply and provides a burn function for holders.  

## 🎯 Project Vision  
The vision of Burnable Token is to create a **deflationary token model** where supply decreases over time as users burn tokens.  
This design can help maintain scarcity, increase long-term value, and serve as a foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.  

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- Add **minting capabilities** for the owner to control supply.  
- Integrate **SIP-010 compliance** for standard fungible token behavior.  
- Build a **DApp interface** for users to burn tokens easily.  
- Extend functionality for staking, governance, and reward mechanisms.
